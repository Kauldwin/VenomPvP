# Changelog for the News Hub, it checks for changes every few minutes then will alert everyone online with a Title Message / Sub Title and in-chat.
# If someone logs on and there has been new updates since they've last been online, it'll alert them in-game and any time they change servers.
# I advise against using additional color / formatting that's different than what we added in but IF you do want to change something, you need to set the formatting back to what it was.
# i.e. You're using - c, so that display's text in yellow and you wanted to change "you" to green, it'd be: - c Hello, &ayou &eare amazing!
# Use https://currentmillis.com/ for the currentmillis
# All Vairables are optional, nothing needs to be used and you just enter a new line for lists.
# /l - Title Message
# /a - Author
# /s - Server
# /r - Reference Issue (DON'T USE, MUCH BAD)
# /m - Display Item (Supports Item IDs! i.e. 35:14)
# x - Used to display what's been removed in red with a lightning bolt next to it
# a - Used to display what's been added in green with a paperclip next to it
# c - Used to display what's been changed in yellow with a sun next to it
# w - Used to display a warning in orange with a warning symbol next to it 
# Anything else is just italic gray crap bulleted

- /l Title Of The Issue Here # Can't use multiple lines for things like Titles (Obviously)
- /a SwiftSwamp # This would list as "SwiftSwamp, SomeoneElse" for the Authors.
- /a SomeoneElse
- /s SomeServerName # If no servers are defined, it'll simply just say the change / update is for "All Servers"
- /s SomeOtherServerName
- /r 489 # This isn't to be used but what it was meant for is you'd type in the issue tracker reference id and it'd link the update / change to the respected issue(s)
- /m 35:15 # This will make the item that pops up in the GUI a Red Piece of Wool
- x Some shit's been removed here.
- x Some more shit has been removed, it even auto formats it so it doesn't go way off the screen! You can cram so much text!!
- a Yay, addition's!
- c Oh god, here comes a nerf!
- w WARNING: YOU'RE FUCKED
- Anything else.. i.e. descriptions, how to use it, etc. displayed in gray text. Usually I'd keep the order that I've made it i.e. Removed shit first, additions, changes then details at the bottom.

log-1480614984745:
- /l Missing Chunk Glitch Fixed
- /a cyberpwn
- /m GRASS
- c Fixed an issue where chunks would sometimes vanish (16x16x16 sections)
- If you are still having issues with this, you can try several things.
- w 1). Try actually going inside of the chunk (this will force it to fix)
- w 2). Use /spawn, and then /back (or /home)
